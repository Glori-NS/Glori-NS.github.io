        <p>Hey there! I'm Gloribeth Navarro-Sickles, a tech enthusiast and a soon-to-be Master of Computer Science graduate from Full Sail University, 
            where I'm diving deep into the cool worlds of software engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. With a vibrant career in technical recruitment and human resources, 
            I've played key roles at big names like Amazon Web Services and Uber Technologies, spearheading recruitment strategies and leading awesome teams.</p>

        <p>My passion? Harnessing the power of data to make smart decisions and build innovative tech solutions. I've crafted a bunch of projects ranging from sleek web applications to smart computer vision systems,
             all using my favorite tools like Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Whether it's Django for web development or Tableau for making data look pretty,
              I love mixing creativity with technology.</p>
        
        <p>I also hold an MBA from Capella University and a Bachelor's degree in Science from Berkeley College, blending my tech savvy with solid business insights. 
            Oh, and Iâ€™m proud to have been recognized for promoting diversity and inclusion in tech, which is super important to me.</p>

        <p>I'm on the lookout to bring my blend of skills and enthusiasm to a role focused on back-end software engineering or data engineering, where I can keep on learning and innovating. 
            Let's make something amazing together!</p>
